# Text-To-Speech Javascript App
Simple text to speech Javascript application that uses the Web Speech API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API). The app allows users to type some text, choose a voice and language, alter the volume, pitch, and playback speed, and then hear the text spoken out loud. I created this project because I am very interested in digital accessibility, and to learn more about consuming APIs.
